# StockPredictionRNN
High Frequency Trading Price Prediction using LSTM Recursive Neural Networks   

In this project we try to use recurrent neural network with long short term memory 
to predict prices in high frequency stock exchange. This program implements such a solution 
on data from NYSE OpenBook history which allows to recreate the limit order book for any given time.
Everything is described in our paper: [project.pdf](https://github.com/dzitkowskik/StockPredictionRNN/blob/master/docs/project.pdf)
